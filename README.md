# Welcome!

I made this bot as a submission to the Halite 2 Programming competition back in early 2018. This showcases the quality of code I wrote before I went to university, which is obviously not the highest. Nonetheless, it got me to rank 946 out of 5833 players, which is something. You can see my profile [here](https://2017.halite.io/user/?user_id=7085)

Everything in this repo is from the starter kit, except the Dalek.py, which is the main logic of the bots.
